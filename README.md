# Horiseon-Bugfix-Project
A repository for the Week 1 challenge of the Monash University Bootcamp.

## About this repository
This repository is a part of the coursework for the Monash University Web Development Bootcamp, this task was a code refactor and the key objectives were as follows:
* **Ensure that HTML elements follow a logical structure**
* **Create accessible alt atributes for the images in the web page**
* **Ensure that heading attributes are in sequential order**
* **Give the webpage a concise, descriptive title**
* **Add comments to your code to describe how the code functions**
* **Add a descriptive README to your repository describing the website and your task**

## Challenges
There were two things I found difficult during this project, first was trying to make the CSS neat and orderly. I believe I have done a decent job but I found myself struggling to understand the direct order of broard to narrow specifically in regard to the classes when organising the the Styles.css file. Second, was adding comments, the HTML file was straight fairly straight forward but the CSS comments were sometimes hard to define.

## About the website
The website is a mockup of a fictitious marketing agency that is designing their website to adhere to the basic accessibility standards in order to optimize their site for search engines.
